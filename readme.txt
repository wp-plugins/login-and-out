Adds a user friendly widget to make login/logout easy. Compatible WP 2.7+

== Description ==

Although WordPress comes with a similar feature, called the "Meta" widget, the built in Meta control uses a lot of screen space and presents more information than some site designers would like. This Login/Logout widget provides web designers with a compact alternative.

Website administrators simply need to download and unzip the software, then copy one file to their WordPress plugins directory. Then login to WordPress as an administrator, go to the Plugins control panel and activate the plugin. Once activated, they can add the Login-Logout widget to any Widget-enabled WordPress sidebar.


== Installation ==

1. Copy the file login-and-out.php to your WordPress plugins directory.
2. Login to WordPress as an administrator, go to Plugins and Activate it.
3. Add the Hypervisor Login-Logout widget to your Widget-enabled Sidebar
   instead of the default "Meta" Widget
